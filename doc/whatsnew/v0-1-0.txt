v0.1.0 (January 17, 2019)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

ATTENTION: From v0.1.0 on power (coefficient) curves are provided by the OpenEnergy Database (oedb) instead of in csv files (v0.6.0 and lower) due to legal reasons.
Use :py:func:`~wind_turbine.get_turbine_types` to check whether the turbine types you need are included in the database.
If your turbine type is not included you can either use your own csv file or open an issue.

New classes
###########

 * WindFarm class for modelling a wind farm. Defines a standard set of wind farm attributes, for example aggregated power curve and wind farm efficiency to take wake losses into account.
 * WindTurbineCluster class for modelling a turbine cluster that contains several wind turbines and/or wind farms. This class is useful for gathering all wind turbines in a weather data grid cell. An aggregated power curve can be calculated which considers the wake losses of the wind farms by a set efficiency if desired.
 * TurbineClusterModelChain class shows the usage of new functions and classes of windpowerlib v.0.1 and is based on the ModelChain class.

New functions
#############

 * power curve smoothing for taking into account the spatial distribution of wind speed
 * application of wake losses to a power curve
 * application of wake losses to a wind speed time series by using wind efficiency curves which are provided in the data directory
 * logarithmic interpolation/extrapolation for wind speed time series
 * gauss distribution (needed for power curve smoothing)
 * estimation of turbulence intensity by roughness length
 * retrieve power curves from OpenEnergy Database


Testing
#######

 * added continuous integration to automatically test the windpowerlib for different python versions and to check the test coverage


Documentation
#############

 * added second example section and jupyter notebook
 * added model description


API changes
###########

 * renamed attribute `turbine_name` of WindTurbine class to `name` to match with `name` attribute of WindFarm and WindTurbineCluster class
 * renamed `basic_example` to `modelchain_example`
 * renamed column 'values' of power (coefficient) curves to 'value' to prevent errors using df.value(s)
 * renamed `run_basic_example()` to `run_example()` in `modelchain_example`
 * renamed parameter `wind_turbine` of `ModelChain` object to `power_plant`
 * removed parameter `density_correction` from `power_plant.power_coefficient()`


Other changes
#############
 * removed deprecated attributes (.ix)
 * added `turbine_cluster_modelchain_example` showing the usage of the TurbineClusterModelChain
