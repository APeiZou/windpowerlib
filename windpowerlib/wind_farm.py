class WindFarm(object):
    r"""
    Defines a standard set of wind farm attributes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    wind_farm_name : string
        Name of the wind farm.
    wind_turbine_fleet : List of Dictionaries
        Wind turbines of wind farm. Dictionaries must have 'wind_turbine'
        (contains wind turbine object) and 'number_of_turbines' (number of
        turbine type in wind farm) as keys.
    coordinates : List
        List of coordinates [lat, lon] of location for loading data.

    Attributes
    ----------
    wind_farm_name : string
        Name of the wind farm.
    wind_turbine_fleet : List of Dictionaries
        Wind turbines of wind farm. Dictionaries must have 'wind_turbine'
        (contains wind turbine object) and 'number_of_turbines' (number of
        turbine type in wind farm) as keys.
    coordinates : List
        List of coordinates (floats) of location for loading data.
        Example: [lat, lon]
    power_curve : pandas.DataFrame or None
        Power curve of the wind turbine. DataFrame has 'wind_speed' and
        'values' columns with wind speeds in m/s and the corresponding power
        curve value in W.
    power_output : pandas.Series
        The calculated power output of the wind farm.
    annual_energy_output : float
        The calculated annual energy output of the wind farm.
